-- List the teachers who have NULL for their department.
SELECT name FROM teacher
  WHERE dept IS NULL

-- Note the INNER JOIN misses the teachers with no department and the departments with no teacher.
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
 FROM teacher INNER JOIN dept
           ON (teacher.dept=dept.id)
    
-- Use a different JOIN so that all teachers are listed.
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
 FROM teacher LEFT JOIN dept
           ON (teacher.dept=dept.id)

-- Use a different JOIN so that all departments are listed.
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
 FROM teacher RIGHT JOIN dept
           ON (teacher.dept=dept.id)
